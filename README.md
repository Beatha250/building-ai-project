# AI That Helps Tell Whether an Animal Is a Dog or a Cat

## Summary
This project describes a simple AI system that helps decide whether an animal is a dog or a cat using basic measurements such as height, weight, and length.

## How it works
The AI is trained using example data where the animal type is already known. After learning from this data, it can predict whether a new animal is more likely to be a dog or a cat.

## Why this is useful
This project helps beginners understand how AI learns from data and how predictions are made. It could also be useful in places like animal shelters or veterinary clinics.
